0 That is a very offensive post:-).
9 Pretty neat.
7 I just bought a 2215 , and
6 there's no Pokcet Access.
6 The 2210 doesn't come with a serial cable.
7 I have a feeling
9 it seems to work.
6 any stores currently have the iPAQ 5150 or iPAQ 5550 in stock right now.
7 I just purchased an HP/iPAQ h2215 PPC.
6 It will show the text but not the image.

6 Restore cannot be completed successfully.
7 i can ping my pocketpc from my laptop,
0 I'm new to Pocket PC multimedia,

4 As anyone else had problems with the 1.11 upgrade and SD cards?
4 Is it better to use GAPI, DirectX or just use the GDI APIs?

6 all mail is synchronised with Outlook 2002 which is connected to an SBS 2000 server.
7 I use Bluetooth to sync and BT is off

1 I'm just trying to avoid potential problems areas in terms of what order to do things etc.
7 I've been reading a lot about the 55xx series
7 I can then reenable WEP on the 2 units and
6 the Pocket Plus program by SBP Software is a very useful plug-in.
7 Yesterday I was a silly boy and installed some software without reading the support specs.
0 ive found the problem,
4 What's the difference between these 2 models
5 You should check the newsgroup.
4 of what value is the TAP at all?
5 please do so.
6 The only way to surf the net on a Thera is through the internal browser.
9 Maybe I'm concerned for nothing
9 So I think its active sync.
7 I refused to let them search my backpack on the way out of the store.
6 according to the Dell documentation it should be off by default.
5 Just sell your unit and
1 I would like to have Sales Demo, Set-up & Train, Courtesy Call rather than Birthday, Dinner and Lunch.
6 The Targus Stowaway for the HP Jornada works for both the 54x and 56x models.
4 BTW, is there any way to rollback to previous version in case

5 You might want to ask the manager to explain this.
1 I'm keen to have a go at fixing this problem

4 Is it possible to setup Internet Connection Sharing on the PPC
7 Mine works perfectly.
4 How do I connect my iPAQ 3760  pc?
1 i was wondering
7 my E740 has let me down.
7 I insisted to leave my 5455 to be sent back to HP.
7 I've not been to CompUSA, and
9 I should receive my 2210 within the next couple of days.
7 I can get quite a few rechargeable batteries at that price.
6 this was already reported.
7 I have read
5 don't worry about it.
7 so that I may access internet on the desktop using the Verizon Aircard.
7 I went ahead and ordered POP service from Yahoo

6 You will get those problems
7 My isp is msn.
7 I'm not sure.
8 I don't want to end up with a Norwegian user interface
10 Say if I have english version of pocketpc,
8 I really like the ease of setting up the wifi connections.
5 look at the string tables.
10 If one is advertised as being suitable for 3800, 3900, 5400,
6 The expansion pack for the Tosh E740 allows both .
7 I have tried everything I know with no success.
1 Any info on a unimportant matter would be appreciated.
6 that is suppose to be out and was really interested in it until
3 Dont worry about the spelling errors, because I don't!
7 I checked the inbox to make sure that
7 I upgraded to 1.10 ROM
4 Or heard of a scaled down version that would work?
4 Anyone know of an online store that has these in stock yet?
4 can somebody tell me the main differce between Pocket PC 2002 and MS Windows Moblie 2003 Prof. Edition.
7 a wireless G router i have updated the wlam firmware
7 it helped me with my Axim!
7 But I do know that
5 If you have step-by-step instructions or
0 That's complete bullshit.
6 this latest one and have not had any probs.
6 No need to install the downloadable version from MS

6 The fact that the Palm could handle 3,000 contacts,
1 Im going to talk to my lawyer on monday as
10 until the next Axim powerdown.
5 then delete it and
10 if available in your area,
0 I assume no PPC driver exists because there aren't any compatible PPCs to use it!
10 if the same Stowaway keyboard will fit,
6 There are various models available on E-Bay and elsewhere.
7 I got totally confused about the followings; 1.
6 I've seen the price on Dell's Web Page YOYO almost daily ;-)
6 A hard reset is not really an option here.
6 or there are defective parts in the unit
4 can suggest a web site
10 even though it doesn't power the GPS.
4 is it possible in Pocket PC 2002 or MS Mobile 2003 Prof. to create user defined Forms for Outlook?
7 I can move, delete, change its name, but
6 it tells me:
1 I wonder
10 but ever since whenever I come out of stand by
10 if that works now.
6 i1910 does not have built-in camera or phone.
6 it ALWAYS does.
4 how did you get around this problem?
4 Can anyone tell me
4 is there  a 2003 upgrade available?
7 Their web site advertises the SD one as being a Palm OS version, but
4 How can I do this programmatically?
6 Bottom line is that
1 I'd hold off getting the 55xx
1 I am upgrading from the 3955.
9 From a legal standpoint, you've already purchased the merchandise,
4 What are you actually buying?
7 thought I knew how to select and open a file.
9 you could easily spend more for the data plans than your landline costs you!
6 The situation now is that
9 I guess you mean the CD?
8 My preferred solution is to use an external GSM/GPRS phone over Bluetooth.
7 I own a P.D.A compaq 3950 model,
6 so you can't upgrade them.
1 I'll check into it.
6 File format not supported.
10 IF you can gain the internet with you PPC, then
5 Try this
4 Is there any news as to the processor, speed, battery life, etc?
7 then I ordered 1945 on hp-online without anxiety.
4 Anyone can tell me the reason?
6 Both use the PXA255.
5 * Use the USB cable to connect to the USB port on the back of this desktop computer.
6 I've also seem CF based VGA adaaptors somewhere.
9 Very nice.
8 I'd like to also view Japanese or Chinese e-mails/web sites/messages/text/etc.
7 I even killed Active sync and
7 I was using my Palm mainely for files applications & Excell  and appointment.
6 The favorites content is synced in 2 steps.
7 I use Pocket Plan from Twiddlebit.
5 To switch to view by Company, look for the 'View' menu on the bottom of the screen in contacts.
7 I knew this shit would happen cause
6 for about two days it seemed to work randomly.
4 what could stop one of these SD cameras from working in a Pocket PC?
4 Does anyone know
10 Even after a soft reset.
6 It is not viewable on your PC.
10 However when I try to restore the backup from the previous synchronisation
6 First it goes to your PC from the information provider according to the settings in Internet Explorer  on your PC.
9 that would allow Windows to install it as a modem, then connect through it.
7 I understand there is an issue with compatible drivers for MS Windows Mobile 2003.
0 I am reasonably new to the PPC OS and
7 but I just figured
4 Can this be done on these machines/ are compilers available?
9 I don't see that ever changing.
6 the first connection has to be serial or USB, but not necessarily a hardwired one.
6 that is not available via favorites and vice versa.
5 keep your accessories.
0 Not too smart!
0 I absolutely despise CompUSA,
2 you can try reinstalling ActiveSync.
0 I'll assume all is well for now.
6 Its my page and
10 if it's possible and easy to add foreign languages support on pocketpc.
10 if they clearly post a sign on your way into the store
9 A third option would be to purchase a Serial Cable for the IPaq,
6 ActiveSync only knows about My Documents in main memory.
10 When I was conned into this TAP
6 Inventory control and/or loss prevention is not my responsibility.
10 Well if you are going to get another iPaq like the 5455 of 5555 then
1 I would indeed like to use a serial cable.
4 what processor is in these models is it the newer PXA 255 or the PXA 250?
1 I'm wondering,
6 I use GSPlayer and OGG Vorbis,
1 I'll just stay with my homemade solution,
5 Upgrade the ROM and install programs from scratch
6 I also know despite all the good experiences with their other products,
7 I have a CF V.90 Modem, Conexant brand
9 A paper manual *would* have been good.
6 With sufficiently recent ROM versions, all 3900 and 5450 series iPAQs support SDIO Now!
6 The difference between 1940 and 1945 2.
3 Dont worry about the spelling errors, because I don't!
7 I put the proper SMTP address and POP address's
6 There are other fine examples of poor localization.
7 I don't honestly know the answers to the other questions.
6 That answered my initial question.
7 Now I'm back home and
7 I have a iPAQ 5450 which
6 The selected backup file was created from a different type of mobile device.
7 I can highlight the file.
4 anyone got any clues?
7 Oh, the desktop is a Dell Dimension running Windows XP.
7 I am now left with a brand new iPaq h5450
1 I could use some help.
7 i get this working.
6 Reverted back to 1.10 and everything is okay.
7 At the moment the unit is sitting on my desk with its AC Adapter connected, charging up the battery as specified.
6 that allow you to customize it to your liking
0 I am a one month old Palm convert.
9 The other possibility is that
4 Is there a way to delete duplicates quickly on the pocket PC?
6 In other words, you can only turn it on by pressing the power button.
6 the others couldn't connect!
6 it was totally dead,
7 Tho I already spent the $ on Yahoo's POP mail service.
7 I'm stuck with a device
5 Why not just delete all shortcuts to it?
4 So what's with this reset business?
6 The desktop version of Outlook is included with the Dell Axim.
9 this has something to do with dashboard, but
6 The synchronization between MS Project 2002 and the Pocket PC works very well.
6 there is a registry setting that
4 Or could we only use the standart outlook forms?
0 Consider yourself lucky!
4 Is this normal or is there a glitch in the OS?
2 You can find my blog on this topic
4 I wonder if there are any special things I need to consider?
6 Its free and easy to use.
7 My main reason for installing this software was for the desktop/ppc remote control function.
6 the Axim X5 isn't going to support SDIO -
4 would I be able to access the Internet and download emails as fast as a desktop PC with the same setup?
6 he was able to keep his old pcmcia sleeve and
6 the program doesn't startsoft-reset and
6 but functionaility does not .
9 the ROM may be corrupted,
5 Why don't you just share the connection from your notebook to your  Pocket PC.
6 the master PC will have to be running for other networked devices to use the internet.
6 Everything is good at this point.
4 Does anyone know
4 Any ideas?
0 You are out of luck there -
1 I'm trying to research the best way to display  running Pocket PC.
7 I recently sent my Ipaq 3970 to be repaired and

6 that states any bags may be searched.
10 When i open the activesync on my laptop
8 I would like to get a PocketPC with Internet and email access.
9 That'd be cool.
6 though some do have at least rudimentary 'pass through' features.
4 is there not really any difference apart from the route to market?
7 I cant create a connection to my desktop via Active Sync and
7 I installed a piece of software and removed it successfully
7 I pretty much just eject and re-insert the SD card.
9 I guess
5 Open File Explorer and navigate to My Device>Windows>Startup.
7 I have no clue about these mapopolis and other software out there
4 how can i do a hard reset on a H1915
7 I have cracked several LCD screens.
6 however more often than not some button gets pressed by accident and turns the unit on thus killing the battery.
6 which wont start up beyond the HP screen.
7 so I can't remember what I did.
7 while I was on vacation.
5 Keep checking they change the prices often
7 I called compaq yestreday
7 I used HanDBase 3 for the Palm and HanDBase 3 for the pocket PC
1 I like to view it on a PPC but as yet have not worked out how.
1 I'd be interested in your suggestions, and/or experiences, both good, and bad.
7 In the dashboard skins tab the only two options I have are compaq.dsh and merlin.dsh.
10 Even if I delete the connection setting
2 you sure can gain the internet connection with your notebook and share it with your PPC
10 if there is another factor for the mini thumb keyboards, in that
7 I can download some good samples on how to do this?
7 Having real difficulties.
3 DO NOT install the WLAN firmware update
6 'After installing the battery  you will need to reset'
9 You may need to go to MP9 & PPC2K3.
4 what is a TAP?
7 So far, I've read that the Ambicom, and Socket, work with their newest, or beta drivers.

4 How about the small mini thumb keyboards you slide on the bottom end of the PDA?
9 I guess
7 i'm afraid
6 the auto check feature was offit was.
4 Is there a simple reference somewhere I need to remove?
6 I haven't seen those in stores yet, which still carry HP's older design.
7 I've also found
6 but this does not work.
3 you can not upgrade the 1910
7 entered all the data I needed at the time.
6 The 5555 is in the cradle but NOT connected via USB.

6 there isn't, at least not yet.
4 How to update my iPaq from Pocket PC 2000 to Pocket PC 2002?
7 I can not see a massive change in the OS
6 They're both the same machine.
7 At present im turning it off by clicking on the signal strength button at the bottom right of the screen and unchecking the option.
9 I think
4 Can anyone tell me where I can find a guide that compares the different ipacs found on the market today?
6 they only support memory cards, and not peripherals like GPS, network cards or cameras.
1 it would be great if you could shear them with me right at this point!
7 I can have inbuilt phone & camera attached to HP1910 .
7 I use i.e personal contacts vendors
6 There are broken ones on Ebay all the time.
6 there's any way to share that connection.
4 will terminal service for pocket pc work on 2003?
4 Does anyone know?
6 The only ones listed are 395x and 397x.
6 PPC couldn't, always indicated to me that
6 it has returned with a new motherboard and battery this time
4 Is it as simple as uninstalling the Palm and installing the Dell?
7 I uninstalled
6 As of right now there is no way to make speaker phone the default.
9 that would help
6 they must have the same connector.
9 It also seems to run some of the programs faster.
6 he was steadfast in his assesment of my situation.
7 I got it off Ebay for $280 including S&H Brand New supposedly.
6 because they don't have it.
4 What optimization do you want?
6 Checked by AVG anti-virus system .
2 You can sync by categories in ActiveSync.
9 I imagine a VAR of some sort.
7 I am running Windows ME and have the newest Activesync 3.7.
7 I have never been let down by ANY Toshiba product the way

6 its connectivity has been interesting to say the least,
1 I would just keep the sleeves as they are compatible.
9 I think they're similar enough that I can answer this.
9 The first place I would check would be in the StartUp folder.
7 The same thing happens to me on my 3955 on occasion.
6 there is to be a 5100 series
9 That should foil most users from getting at it
4 Can the screen saver be used separately from the mini keyboard?
6 it started up again.
3 Dont worry about the spelling errors, because I don't!
